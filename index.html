                <h3>Rural Access Index (RAI)</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a measure of the proportion of the rural population living within 2 kilometres
                    of an all-weather road. The RAI is important as it measures people's transport accessibility in
                    rural areas.

                    <p>To determine where people live, or the <b>population distribution in rural areas</b>, the
                        Rural Access Index
                        uses WorldPopdata.<br />
                        WorldPop estimates the number of people living in each 100 by 100 square
                        meter on earth using
                        remotely-sensed and geospatial datasets (settlement locations, settlement extents,
                        land cover, roads,
                        building maps, health facility locations, satellite nightlights, vegetation,
                        topography and refugee

                        survey in 2018, for planning
                        of road maintenance. The survey assessed the type of surface and the condition of
                        approximately 420,000 road
                        segments, covering almost 250,000 kilometres (155,000 miles).

                        From the roads data (Good Quality Roads), a 2 Kilometer buffer is created to designate areas

                        Finally, the population of people living within the 2 kilometres buffer zone is computed. For
                        this county, the rural population is <span id="finalpupulation"></span>. This
                        pupulation is the uses to determine the rural access index using the formula
